items:

- algos eg implement mergesort
- concepts eg what is closure

- project code spelunking eg tell me about this function you wrote for your project
- coding challenge eg build an app that allows users to create and share quizzes
- logic/reasoning eg how many golf balls fit in a bus
- architecture eg design battleship

algos
- reacto

concept
- trivia
- but focus on what you do know
- use examples and metaphors
- goal: show depth, passion, communication skills

code analysis
- reasoning >> truth
- your job involves looking at code you didnt write

spelunking
- validate your contribution
- get a sense of project planning
- tangible sense of you as a programmer
- your past doesnt define your present
