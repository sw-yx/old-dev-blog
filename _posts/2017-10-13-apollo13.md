i listened the Apollo and Relay team duke it out on GraphQL radio yesterday and it was pretty cool. it seems they will reach an uneasy convergence.

meanwhile the apollo team's tooling is solid. i am messing around on their playground today: <https://launchpad.graphql.com/3xp1vx3lv>

[i forked graphiql to do some of my own tweaks](https://github.com/sw-yx/swyx-graphiql)! also PR'ed to fix a doc: <https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/issues/619>
