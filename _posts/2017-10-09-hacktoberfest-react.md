my learning journey in contributing to OSS continues: <https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11149#discussion_r143607735> and <https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/pull/81#discussion_r143566699>

I am finding i have to remove files from Git commit often and this was very helpful: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12481639/remove-files-from-git-commit>

i got a `git fatal: BUG: initial ref transaction called with existing refs` error and had to trash my whole react repo.
