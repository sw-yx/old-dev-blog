i submitted my first PR to react! <https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11149>

wasnt actually that hard but the understanding required to get to a point where i could parse React's own code without (much) assistance was gratifying.

and then i read this and wept and how much I still don't know: <https://hackernoon.com/how-i-converted-my-react-app-to-vanillajs-and-whether-or-not-it-was-a-terrible-idea-4b14b1b2faff>

and this: <https://hackernoon.com/your-node-js-authentication-tutorial-is-wrong-f1a3bf831a46>

and this: <https://hackernoon.com/10-things-i-learned-making-the-fastest-site-in-the-world-18a0e1cdf4a7>


basically [David Gilbertson](https://twitter.com/d__gilbertson) is the man and i have no idea who he is


performance reads:
- <https://hpbn.co/building-blocks-of-tcp/#slow-start> - something about just minifying all the things into 14KB
- <https://know-it-all.io/> if you really, really know the basics you can exploit them anywhere
