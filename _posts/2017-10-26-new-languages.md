learning is such a funny beast. it is so frustrating and yet rewarding. When you are struggling to understand something you just feel stupid. When you finally get it you feel like the smartest person in the world.

Today I saw the launch of a whole new language at NYCHTML5. <http://serulian.io/> I think they will do very well.

I also helped a 13 year old kid with a math problem. He was persistent (in fact we gave up once but I gave him a hint and he came right back with a (good enough) answer) and after like 30 mins of back and forth we finally solved his math problem. he has straight A's and is determined to be excellent. He has already started to code and I'll probably work for him someday.

All is well in the world.
