title: Techstars NY Summer 2017
---

I attended the Techstars NY S17 demo day today. [Here is the TC overview of each startup](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/28/techstars-nyc-summer-2017/). Note that TC messed up, Ryan Shank is with Phonewagon, not Parakeet.

# Most interesting

The two most interesting startups were [Geopipe](https://geopi.pe/) and [Phonewagon](https://phonewagon.com/) ([pitch here](https://techstars.wistia.com/medias/hgpk0rsjmy)) with honorary mention going to [SVRF](https://www.svrf.com/).

Geopipe showed off probably the "deepest" tech which is funny to observe for a tech accelerator program. They combine open and licensed satellite data scans to build 3d models (including texture models eg. they can tell the difference between concrete and glass) and I am aware of how deep of a pain point this is. Their demo failed on demo but they pulled through the presentation decently. On speaking with [Chris (CEO)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drcmitchell), it was interesting that they had not yet implemented a bunch of the easy web dev wins and were lookign for a part time web dev. I threw my hat in even though I probably can't work for them. I think they are very likely to get acquired at some point down the road.

Phonewagon is kind of the opposite of Geopipe - shallow, mass market SaaS platform that applies to SMBs. Their key advantage really comes from marketing and CEO [Ryan Shank](http://youtube.com/c/RyanShank) embodies that with humor and personality (I mean, [he has a videographer follow him around for his daily vlog](https://twitter.com/ryanashank) - inspired by Gary Vee). He has had a prior exit (to HomeAway) and was self aware that he didnt wan't to come across as a douche. I also had a good chat with [CPO Mike Horton](https://www.themikehorton.com/) about the challenges of working with an indian dev team to create a product in the US. Overall I think they have a unique offering for the SMB market and should find some decent traction, although who knows if its the $50m opportunity Ryan is looking for.

SVRF was an odd beast. It was an instantly entertaining tech demo ([go to this on your phone](https://www.svrf.com/)) but [the CEO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophiaedm/) seemed somewhat high and flat out admitted they ~had no business plan~ were going for distribution first. But they were super super fun and they reminded me of Giphy which is worth $600m.

# Could be better

Then there were the rest. CottageClass seemed run of the mill. Gather had a great UI but was insufficiently differentiated from existing solutions I am familiar with. Ditto Parakeet. Hawthorne had the best website but is solving a problem no one has. Matchaful is only really worth tracking if you believe matcha will kill coffee. Obsess' CEO was singularly unconvincing, with Vitally a moderately close second. Virgo has great focus but the traction has been extremely disappointing so far. TypeLead was very promising but didn't seem all that different from raw Haskell (which I have experience with, working with Neil Mitchell of [Hoogle](https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/) fame for 2 years.

# overall

Was overall a great evening and inspiring to see the kind of company Techstars supports. I do wish there was more orginality and flat out WOW moments.
